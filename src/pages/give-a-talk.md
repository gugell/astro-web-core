# MobileHeads: A Community for Mobile Engineers

## Everyone Has a Story to Tell

Welcome to **MobileHeads**, where mobile engineers share their stories, ideas, and experiences. Whether you're an expert or just starting out, your story matters. Here’s how you can get involved:

- **Built a cool framework or library?** Tell us about it!
- **Tried a new library for the first time?** Share what you learned.
- **Experimented with new features?** Let us know how it went!
- **Working on a fun weekend project?** We’d love to hear about it.
- **Found a useful trick?** Show us how it works.

Our talks are short and simple, lasting up to 30 minutes. First-time speakers are always welcome. If you have questions, email us at [ask.mobileheads@gmail.com](mailto:ask.mobileheads@gmail.com).
